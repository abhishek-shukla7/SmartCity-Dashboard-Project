# Smart City Dashboard – Power BI Project

## About the Project
This project is a Smart City Dashboard created using Power BI to analyze and visualize city-level data such as Air Quality (AQI), Energy Consumption, Traffic Fines, and Zone-wise performance.

The main purpose of this dashboard is to understand how different city zones are performing and to identify problem areas using interactive visuals and alerts.

---

## What This Dashboard Shows
- Air Quality Index (AQI) analysis across zones
- Energy usage trends over time
- Traffic fines and delays
- Alert-based classification of zones (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy)
- Detailed analysis for individual zones

- AQI and Energy trends
- City health summary
- Filters for date and zone

### 2. Map & Sensor View
- Map-based visualization of city zones
- AQI distribution using sensors
- Interactive zone filtering

### 3. Trends & Forecasts
- AQI and Energy trends over time
- Metric toggle (AQI / Energy / Traffic)
- Trend comparison for decision making

### 4. Alerts & Thresholds
- Zone-wise AQI alert levels
- Conditional color formatting
- Alert table with zone and date details
- Filters for date, zone, and metric

### 5. Zone Detail View
