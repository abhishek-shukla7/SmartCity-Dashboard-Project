🏙️ Smart City Infrastructure Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

The Smart City Infrastructure Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to analyze and visualize key urban metrics such as Air Quality (AQI), Energy Usage, Traffic Violations, and City Health Index.
This dashboard helps decision-makers monitor city performance, identify problem zones, and take data-driven actions.

🎯 Objectives

Monitor Air Quality Index (AQI) across multiple zones

Analyze Energy Consumption trends

Track Traffic violations & delays

Identify alert zones using threshold logic

Provide zone-wise and time-based insights

Create a clean, interactive, and professional dashboard
